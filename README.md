**Abstract**: <br />
This report presents Audio Barlow Twins, a novel self-supervised audio representation learning approach. Audio Barlow Twins adapts the [Barlow Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230) [Zbontar _et al._, 2021] objective from Computer Vision (CV) to the audio domain. The Barlow Twins objective encourages the empirical cross-correlation matrix between the embeddings of two distorted views of a data sample towards the identity matrix, thereby both enforcing invariance to the applied data augmentations as well as explicitly preventing representational collapse through decorrelation of the individual components of the embedding vectors (redundancy-reduction). Audio Barlow Twins utilises a combination of different data augmentations, all of which act directly on the audio data preprocessed as mel-spectrograms, and considers both convolutional and Transformer encoder architectures. We pre-train on the large-scale audio dataset AudioSet, and evaluate the quality of the learned representations on 18 tasks from the HEAR 2021 Challenge (https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03022) [Turian _et al._, 2021], achieving results on a par with the current state-of-the-art for instance discrimination self-supervised approaches to audio representation learning. The impact of the individual components of the learning framework are analysed through extensive ablation studies.
